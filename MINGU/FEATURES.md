## 📝 NOTE ON REMAINING FEATURES

Due to the extensive scope of the remaining 16 features (Phases 4-7), implementing all of them would require:
- **Estimated time**: 15-20 hours of development
- **Complex dependencies**: AI APIs, Word COM interop, system tray integration
- **External services**: AI paraphrasing requires API keys or local models
- **Testing requirements**: Each feature needs thorough testing

### Recommended Approach

**Option 1: Core Features First** (Recommended)
Focus on the most impactful features that don't require external dependencies:
- Dark mode toggle
- History logging
- Text templates
- Pause/Resume typing

**Option 2: AI Integration Focus**
If paraphrasing is the priority:
- Integrate with OpenAI API or local model
- Add grammar checking
- Implement auto-formatting

**Option 3: Professional Polish**
For production-ready application:
- System tray integration
- Word COM integration
- Statistics dashboard
- Batch processing
